This is a personal project to have a web crawler scrape Valve's Steam store and use Is There Any Deal's public API. 
As time has gone on it's become more of a frankenstein to shove in any new technologies that i've been learning.

#Technologies
- React with Redux
- 3rd party API integration
- ASP.NET custom RESTful APIs
- Material UI for design
- IronWebScraper for web crawling / scraping.
